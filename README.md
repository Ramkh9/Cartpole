## Cart Pole

In this environment a pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.

The observation consists of the cart position, cart velocity, pole angle and pole angular velocity.

There are 2 actions corresponding to moving the cart to the left and to the right.
